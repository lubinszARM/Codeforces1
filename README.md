Input
You are given the 8 strings whose length equals 8, describing the initial position on the board. The first line represents the top row of the board, the next one â€” for the second from the top, and so on, the last line represents the bottom row. Each character string matches a single cell board in the appropriate row, and the characters are in the same manner as that of the corresponding cell. If the cell is empty, the corresponding character is ".". If a cell has Maria, then it is represented by character "M". If a cell has Anna, it is represented by the character "A". If a cell has a statue, then the cell is represented by character "S".

It is guaranteed that the last character of the first row is always "A", the first character of the last line is always "M". The remaining characters are "." or "S".

Output
If Maria wins, print string "WIN". If the statues win, print string "LOSE".
